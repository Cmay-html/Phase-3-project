# Employment Department Directory CLI Application

This is a command-line workplace management application built using Python, Click for the CLI interface, and SQLAlchemy ORM for database management. Alembic is used for database migrations.

## Features
- Manage departments and their Records
- Manage employees and their positions
- Interactive CLI menu for easy navigation and data entry

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.13
- Click library for CLI prompts and menus
- SQLAlchemy for ORM and SQLite database connection
- Alembic for database migrations and version control

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or copy the source code files.
2. Install dependencies:
3. Initialize the database and apply migrations:


## Running the Application
Run the main application script to start the interactive workplace CLI:

Follow the on-screen prompts to add/view Departments, Positions, Employees.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Contains the command-line interface logic using Click to interact with users.
- `models.py`: Defines SQLAlchemy ORM models for Departments, Positions and Employees with relationships.
- `crud.py`: CRUD operations used by the CLI to interact with the database.
- `alembic/`: Contains Alembic migration scripts and configuration to manage database schema changes.
- `database.db`: SQLite database file created by SQLAlchemy.

## Database Models Overview
- **Department**: Stores department information and has one-to-many relationship with `Positions` and one-to-many with `Employees`.
- **Position**: Stores position information and has one-to-many relationship with `Employees`.
- **Employee**: Links both departments and positions via a foreign key.

## Alembic Usage
This project uses Alembic to handle database migrations:
- To create a new migration after model changes:
- To apply migrations to update the database:


## Notes
- The CLI uses input validation and prompts to guide the user through operations.
- Relationships between models use SQLAlchemy's `back_populates` to synchronize linked records.
